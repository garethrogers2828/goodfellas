## Credits

The majority of the code was written referencing Code Institute’s Diploma in Full Stack Software Development

I have enhanced knowledge of bootstrap to reduce the amount of CSS that needs to be written.

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3

I used bootstrap 5 to help make the site responsive on all devices, favicon, fontawesome for the icons to social media, google fonts to import both fonts used. I used bootstrap containers and columns to help make the conent and images responsive on all devices. I used Bootstrap for the table of opening/closing days and times.
